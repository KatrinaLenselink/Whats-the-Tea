                Every individual deserves the same control over simply choosing the amount of sugar or milk along with knowing what tea bags will release more plastic into your hot drink. With the expansive environmental issues surrounding plastic, our project adheres to a literal small issue being microplastics that raises unknown health concerns over human consumption as they seep into hot beverages majorly from teabags.  To the extent of 11.6 billion microplastics and 3.1 nanoplastics can be shedding into a single cup and overall an average person's plastic intake is 5 grams every week (Picheta, Rob.) These are invisible and undetectable by taste so the healthy alternatives compared to plastic, nylon, or polypropylene heat sealed bags are strainers, loose leaf and or liquid tea concentrates.
                
    </p>
   

    <p>
        
        We chose to focus specifically on the microplastics and environmental practices of restaurants to make tackling a world issue more manageable. We believe that we should start working towards improving our environmental habits by making a few healthier and more conscientious choices in our personal lives before trying to make changes on a larger scale. This was also a problem that we felt strongly about as a lot of us are tea drinkers and we wanted a way of being able to know which places are ensuring healthier options for tea. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Branching this potential health risk we devised an app to provide users to search up restaurants to be able to find their score on how eco-friendly but more importantly if they use the right alternative methods that won’t release upon billions of microplastics into your single cup. By doing so our app, ‘What’s the Tea Sis?’ indirectly boycotts the businesses that are not environmentally conscious and provides educational intel on the issue to become aware of its impact. The name references a millennial and Generation Z phrase that translates to ‘what’s the gossip?’ and we found it to be perfectly fitting to our idea due to the app dealing with tea and that we are notifying users with possible new information. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Our app is mainly targeted towards tea drinkers with a focus on microplastics in tea bags. The typical user will be health conscious and want to avoid tea companies with the risk of microplastics or other health concerns. They will use technology for health and fitness related information with this app helping them keep track of healthy and sustainable tea brands as well as discover new tea brands that align with their values.This app is also targeted towards businesses and companies who want to promote these values and reach consumers who are looking for healthy and environmentally friendly brands.  What’s the Tea, Sis? will affect consumers who are environmentally conscious and want to make purchasing decisions that implement these values into their daily lives and consumer habits. 
    </p>


    <p>
       Our target audience is teens to adults because this demographic uses their phones often to share and access information. They are tech savvy and will be able to easily understand the app as well as learn about it through social media or news sites. This demographic is also highly aware of environmental issues and want to make a difference through their choices. 
    </p>

    <p>
        What’s the Tea, Sis? will help to increase the awareness of environmental issues as it creates a platform that allows users to learn about and discuss these problems. Users will rate restaurants solely on their environmental practices which is then posted to the review page, allowing others to read the reviews and comments.  The rating system lets people know which places are better for the environment and will encourage users to go to higher rated restaurants in order to be more environmentally conscious. This might convince businesses to change their practices in order to get a better rating and convince more people to come to their business. People can use this platform as a way to create small changes in their local restaurants. The rating system will be anonymous so that there are no ramifications for a bad review and people may feel better about leaving a comment or a review if its anonymous as it’s easier to share opinions. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to the rating feature, this app will also include discussion boards and a section that leads to more information about the issues at hand. This helps to solve the problem because some people don’t know where to look to begin being environmentally friendly.  Part of the problem is that there can sometimes be too much information to take in at once and it can be daunting. In this information section, there will also be suggestions for users on how to implement small environmentally friendly practices into their own lives. This allows them to start small with the changes they are making in their lives and will encourage them to pursue the issues further.
