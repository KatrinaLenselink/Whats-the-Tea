The plastic that you can consume with some tea bag brands have been linked to obesity, infertility, and contains endocrine disruptors that can cause hormone issues.  Stay away from tea products that have been treated with epichlorohydrin as they are also found in pesticides as when it is mixed with water it has the consequence of causing a decreased immune function. An all natural approach to lessen the release of such health issues can be by avoiding plastic, nylon, mesh like, or polypropylene heat sealed bags. Buy organic tea instead so that there is no chance that the ingredients are sprayed by pesticides and makes the decision of using  strainers, loose leaf and or liquid tea concentrates.  </h6>
